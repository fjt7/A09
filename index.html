        <h1>Movie reviews</h1>
        <blockquote>
            &ldquo;Lots of heat but not very much light.
            It came across as a kind of daytime soap opera version
            showing the personalities of<br>
            the players rather than dealing with the nuts and bolts of what really happened.
            Even that would not have been so bad but<br> the movie tries to
            portray lots of these folks as sympathetic figures just trying to do the right thing.&rdquo;
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            &ldquo;I am watching this for the 3rd time, trying to understand how this large group of capitalist pigs could royally screw their<br>
            families, descendants, neighbors, countrymen and the rest of the whole world with absolutely no compassion.&rdquo;
